Description: Implementation of Dirichlet Regression Forest algorithm with 
    maximum likelihood and method of moments parameter estimation. Supports 
    parallel processing for large datasets using both fork-based (Unix/Mac) 
    and cluster-based (Windows) approaches. Supports both averaging-based and weight-based (DRF algorithm) predictions 
    for Dirichlet forest regression.
